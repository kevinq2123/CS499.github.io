              <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
           <p>
            My time in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has helped me in shaping my professional goals. It has prepared me to become a well-rounded candidate for employers. This ePortfolio shows my expertise in the field and showcases my management with large projects to successfully conduct code that functions at a professional level. 
            </p>

            <p>
            In my Software Development Lifecycle CS 250 course, it showed my strength to do agile development with teams and collaboration. It practiced using user stories to develop test cases and helped shape the agile scrum to the direction that satisfies customer feedback. It showed how to know the product well before communicating with stakeholders and address any questions from the stakeholders. Meeting the expectations will help any additional work in the future of the product. Rocha Blogs has allowed me to showcase data structures and algorithms through iterative for loops that display the blogs in a linear format. I use data structures such as a list to manage users that are associated with the particular blog post. I have used software engineering by having practiced principles of object oriented programming in the design pattern of MVC. I used this as the foundation for this project that allowed me to organize the software in a consistent format. Rocha Blogs also used databases for keeping track of the user accounts created, blog posts, and comments. Security is used in Rocha Blogs with authentication and authorization. This identifies the certain user and their role and from that identification, authorizes them certain access based on their role.

            <h2>Code Review</h2>
            <p>
              My code review reflects the code chosen for my three cateogories of Software Engineering and Design, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Databases.
              A link to my code review is located <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFVl4Bm9OMs">here</a>.

           <p>This artifact is Rocha Blogs, where it allows for users to create blog posts, comment, and create accounts to interact with others in the website. </p>

           <b>Course Outcome 1</b>
           <p>
            I employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science. This was done by having this project contain MVC. This design pattern makes it easier for other people to contribute to this code universally without needing to read much documentation on where certain parts of the projects are organized. This shows when creating the time date, and author of the blog post in my data structures and algorithms category. 
          </p>

           <b>Course Outcome 2</b>
           <p>
            I designed, developed, and delivered professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts. I have accomplished this by adding the role and name of the author of the post in my databases category. This allows the comment to identify who left it rather than keeping it anonymous. Having a comment counter for how many total comments in the blog post allows to show the amount of people engaged with the content. This alongside, the front end interface of the blog for the user to navigate that allows for visual communications that are coherent and appropriate for the audience. 
          </p>

           <b>Course Outcome 3</b>
           <p>
            I designed and evaluated computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. I done this in the data structures and algorithms category where I had used an algorithm to stay consistent with showing each blog post in a vertically linear order. This allowed the same format and consistent blog content to be displayed without having random sized images and content that would disarrange the organization of each blog shown. I used O(N) notation for this as N represents each blog post contained in the database. 
          </p>

           <b>Course Outcome 4</b>
           <p>
            I demonstrated the ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. I did this in the software engineering and design category. Adding required input from the user in the register allowed for information such as a username, email, and password as required input to proceed with the process. This practice keeps the user in structure for what the application expects and implements computer solutions that keep the project with innovative techniques and skills that prevent absent data. The author being added and allowing for the date time stamp to be involved aligns with accomplishing industry-specific goals that pertain to giving credit to the author and the time the author published the content. 
          </p>

           <b>Course Outcome 5</b>
           <p>
            I developed a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources. I did this with software engineering and design category. I have modified the register page to have character constraints from the username, password, name, etc. This prevented from exceeding certain characters that could be a potential malicious injection that can cause the site to corrupt. This also prevents weak passwords that can make users vulnerable to suspected malicious brute force attacks.
